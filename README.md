# *Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python*

_AIM:_
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

_ALGORITHM:_

Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
Print the value of a with the label "a is".
Print the value of b with the label "b is".
Print the value of c with the label "c:".
Print the value of d with the label "d:".

# *🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python*

_AIM:_
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

_ALGORITHM:_

Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
Print the complex number x.
Print the real part of x using x.real.
Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.

# *Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python*

_AIM:_
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

_ALGORITHM:_

Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.
Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
Print the value stored in the variable.

_PROGRAM:_

_RESULT:_
Thus , the program has been executed succesfully.

# *Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker*

_AIM:_
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

_ALGORITHM:_

Get an input from the user.
Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
If true, print "EVEN".
Else, print "ODD".
End the program.
